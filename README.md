# Parallax-Website
<a href="https://peterpetor.github.io/Parallax-Website/">TEST WEBSITE LINK</a>

Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. 
<br>
As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion.
<br>
The website is responsive, fully meets the needs of users and is displayed without any problems on any types of devices and browsers.
